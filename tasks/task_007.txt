# Task ID: 7
# Title: Connect Breed Selection to Gallery Display
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the logic to update the gallery content when a breed is selected, fetching and displaying the appropriate fun facts and images.
# Details:
1. Create a state management system to track selected breed
2. Implement event handlers for breed selection buttons
3. Create a function to fetch fact data for the selected breed
4. Implement gallery update logic when breed changes
5. Add smooth transitions between different breed selections
6. Implement preloading of images for faster display
7. Add error handling for failed image loads
8. Maintain selection state if user navigates away and returns
9. Implement analytics to track breed selections
10. Add visual feedback to show which breed is currently selected

Example state management:
```javascript
let currentBreed = null;

function selectBreed(breedName) {
  currentBreed = breedName;
  updateGallery(breedName);
  updateSelectedBreedVisual(breedName);
  logBreedSelection(breedName);
}

async function updateGallery(breedName) {
  const facts = await fetchBreedFacts(breedName);
  renderFactsToGallery(facts);
}```

# Test Strategy:
Test breed selection and gallery update flow. Verify correct facts are displayed for each breed. Test transitions between breeds. Verify state is maintained when navigating away and back. Test error handling by simulating failed image loads. Verify analytics events are fired correctly.

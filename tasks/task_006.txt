# Test Strategy:
Test gallery layout on various screen sizes. Verify cards are properly spaced and accessible. Test touch interactions on mobile devices. Verify keyboard navigation works correctly. Test with screen readers to ensure accessibility. Verify loading states display correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement responsive gallery layout [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a responsive layout for the gallery component that displays 5 fact cards without scrolling, ensuring proper spacing and touch-friendly design.
### Details:
Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout. Implement media queries for different screen sizes. Ensure cards have sufficient spacing for touch targets (at least 44x44 pixels). Test on various devices and orientations.

## 2. Develop interactive fact card component [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a reusable card component with image and caption areas, including animations, focus states, and keyboard navigation.
### Details:
Use the provided HTML structure as a base. Implement CSS transitions for card appearance. Add ':hover' and ':focus' styles. Ensure 'tabindex' attribute is set for keyboard navigation. Use 'aria-' attributes for accessibility.

## 3. Implement image loading and error handling [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Add loading states for images and handle potential errors when fetching or displaying images.
### Details:
Use a placeholder or skeleton screen while images are loading. Implement error handling to display a fallback image or message if the image fails to load. Consider using the 'loading' attribute on img tags for native lazy loading.

## 4. Optimize text readability for children [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Ensure all text in the gallery is large, clear, and easily readable for young children.
### Details:
Use a child-friendly font (e.g., Comic Sans or similar). Set font size to at least 16px, preferably larger. Ensure high contrast between text and background. Use simple language in captions. Consider adding alt text for images that can be read aloud by screen readers.

## 5. Add touch and visual interactivity cues [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.4
### Description: Implement touch interactions and add visual cues to indicate interactivity for young users.
### Details:
Add touch event listeners for swipe gestures between cards. Implement visual feedback for touch interactions (e.g., subtle scale or color change). Add icons or animations to indicate swipe functionality. Ensure all interactive elements have clear visual affordances.

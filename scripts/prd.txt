# Overview

This is a single-page proof-of-concept website designed for children aged 5 and under to learn about dogs. The site uses vibrant visuals, large interactive buttons, and AI-generated images to present five fun facts about five popular dog breeds. Each fact is paired with a matching image to help young children learn through visual association. The goal is to create an engaging, educational, and developmentally appropriate digital experience without requiring login or adult assistance.

# Core Features

## 1. Age Selection Prompt

* **What it does**: Asks the child their age in years and months.
* **Why it's important**: Helps personalize content tone or potentially adjust reading level or visuals in the future.
* **How it works**: Simple dropdown or selection interface shown before the main content loads.

## 2. Breed Selector

* **What it does**: Lets the child choose from five dog breeds (Corgis, Labradors, Pugs, German Shepherds, Dachshunds).
* **Why it's important**: Gives children autonomy and focus; narrows the learning topic.
* **How it works**: Large buttons with cartoon-style dog images representing each breed.

## 3. Fun Fact Gallery

* **What it does**: Displays five AI-generated image cards for each breed, each showing a fun fact.
* **Why it's important**: Provides educational content in a visual and memorable format.
* **How it works**: When a breed is selected, the gallery populates with five cards. Each card has a dog image in context of the fun fact and a short, readable caption.

## 4. AI Image Generation (Back-end)

* **What it does**: Generates five distinct, child-friendly dog images per breed, matched to the fun facts.
* **Why it's important**: Makes the experience unique, visually engaging, and scalable for more breeds later.
* **How it works**: Image prompts are predefined per fun fact and passed to an image generation API.

# User Experience

## User Personas

* **Child Learner (age 3–5)**: Curious, exploratory, enjoys visual stimuli. Cannot read long sentences.
* **Parent/Guardian**: May assist initially but prefers apps that are intuitive for solo child use.

## Key User Flows

1. Child visits website.
2. Selects age (optional personalization step).
3. Chooses a dog breed by tapping an image button.
4. Gallery loads with five visual fun fact cards.
5. Child explores and taps images for fun fact captions.

## UI/UX Considerations

* Bright, inviting colors
* Extra-large buttons for touch use
* Limited text per screen
* Alt text and image descriptions for accessibility
* No scrolling; all facts visible in gallery layout

# Technical Architecture

## System Components

* Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (React or basic static site for MVP)
* Backend: Python Flask or Node.js server to call AI image generation API
* Image Generator: OpenAI’s DALL·E or similar, with predefined prompts per breed/fact
* Hosting: Static hosting (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) or small cloud instance (e.g., Render)

## Data Models

* Breed: Name, icon image, list of facts
* Fact: Text caption, image prompt, image URL

## APIs and Integrations

* Image generation API (OpenAI or Stable Diffusion)
* Optional: logging or analytics for usage

## Infrastructure Requirements

* Minimal: no database for MVP
* JSON file can store breed → facts → prompts → image URL mapping
* CDN for caching AI-generated images

# Development Roadmap

## MVP Requirements

* Age selection UI
* Static breed selection buttons
* Gallery layout with hardcoded facts/images
* Backend logic to generate & store images
* Render gallery from JSON structure

## Future Enhancements

* Audio read-aloud for fun facts
* More breeds
* Personalization by age
* Save/share favorite dogs
* Language selection
* Offline mode / app wrapper

# Logical Dependency Chain

1. Design UX mockup: Buttons, gallery, breed selection layout
2. Create fun fact content: 5 facts × 5 breeds
3. Test AI prompts: Generate initial set of breed/fact images
4. Build breed selection UI
5. Build static gallery layout
6. Integrate backend image fetch/store
7. Connect breed selection to gallery display
8. Wrap into a single-page app or static site

# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges

* **Risk**: AI-generated images may not always be child-appropriate

  * **Mitigation**: Curate prompts and pre-screen images
* **Risk**: Performance issues on slow devices

  * **Mitigation**: Compress images, lazy-load if needed

## MVP Scope Clarity

* **Risk**: Overbuilding before basic working version

  * **Mitigation**: Stick to one-page app, 5 breeds, 5 facts each

## Resource Constraints

* **Risk**: API limits or cost for image generation

  * **Mitigation**: Generate images in advance and cache statically
